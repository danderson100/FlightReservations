# flight-reservations

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION. Will update once finished with program**

A Java program that takes as input Sparse Matrix files of connected cities as nodes in a directed graph. The edges contain cost and time values. Uses recursive backtracking to find all possible flights from Point A to Point B, the cost, the time, and more. Still building UI.
